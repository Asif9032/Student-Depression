# Student Depression  

1. Overview 
This repository contains a **comprehensive study** on student depression, leveraging **data analysis and machine learning** techniques to identify risk factors and predictive insights. The dataset, *StudentDep.csv*, integrates **demographic, academic, and lifestyle factors** to build a predictive model for early detection and intervention strategies.  

2. Purpose & Objectives 
- Understand mental health trends among students.  
- Analyze correlations** between academic pressure, lifestyle habits, and depression risk.  
- Develop a machine learning model to predict students at risk of depression.  
- Provide actionable insights for mental health policies and interventions in educational settings.   

3. Features:  
- ID: Unique identifier for each student  
- Demographics: Age, Gender, City  
- Academic Indicators: CGPA, Academic Pressure, Study Satisfaction  
- Lifestyle & Wellbeing: Sleep Duration, Dietary Habits, Work Pressure, Job Satisfaction, Study/Work Hours  
- Additional Factors: Profession, Degree, Financial Stress, Family History of Mental Illness, Suicidal Thoughts  
- Target Variable: `Depression_Status` (Binary: `0 = No Depression, 1 = Depression`)  

4. Project Workflow  

1. Data Preprocessing & Exploration  
- Load the dataset and inspect its **structure, missing values, and outliers**.  
- Convert categorical variables for analysis, remove duplicates, and ensure **data integrity**.  
- Perform **descriptive statistics** on numerical variables to understand distributions.  

2. Data Analysis & Feature Engineering  
- Conduct **correlation analysis** to determine key factors affecting depression risk.  
- Perform **group-by analysis** on categorical features like gender, academic performance, and work pressure.  
- Engineer **new features** based on sleep patterns, financial stress levels, and academic satisfaction.  

3. Data Visualization  
- Histograms & Box Plots: Distribution of sleep duration, study satisfaction, and financial stress.  
- Scatter Plots: Relationship between CGPA and depression risk.  
- Pie Charts & Bar Charts: Breakdown of depression trends by demographic categories.  
- Heatmaps: Correlation matrix for academic pressure, lifestyle habits, and mental health indicators.  

4. Machine Learning Model Training 
- Train classification models to predict **Depression_Status** using features like **sleep, financial stress, and academic performance**.  
- Compare performance of models: **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost**.  
- Evaluate models using **accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curves**.  

5. Model Evaluation & Interpretation  
- Visualize model predictions vs. actual depression cases.  
- Use **SHAP values** for feature importance analysis.  
- Generate interactive **dashboard reports** for institutional interventions.  

Ethical Considerations 
Due to the **sensitive nature** of mental health data, all research and analysis must follow **privacy guidelines** and **ethical best practices**. Ensure responsible interpretation and safeguard student data during processing.
